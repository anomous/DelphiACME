# ACME (Let's Encrypt protocol) component for Delphi Tokyo
(c)2018 by [Execute SARL](http://www.execute.fr)

## Purpose

TExecuteACME component let you request a "[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)" certificate for you domain.

The component supports HTTP Challenge, you can use a self hosted WebServer (TidHTTPServer) to validate the certificate or use the OnHttpChallenge event to store the challenge reply on your website.

In both case you need to manage the domain's HTTP (not HTTPS) server.

## Installation

this component is compatible with Delphi Tokyo 10.2.3 (even the Community Edition).

1. Download the repository
2. Open ACMEGroup.groupproj
3. Right click on the project "Execute.ACMEDesign.bpl" and install it
4. Select the ACMEDemo project
5. Compile and run the Application

the application requires OpenSSL (libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll)
on the first start, the application can create Account.key and Domain.key for you, (generating a 4096bits take some time, this is normal).

Account.key will be your Let's Encrypt account private key, place it on a safe place (with a password).

Domain.key is the private key for the domain (same recommandations).
	
## How does it work ?

### 1. Registration request
	TExecuteACME.RegisterDomain();
	 -> Account.key     -> register a Let's Encrypt account.
	 -> Domain.key      -> send a Certification Signing Request.
	 -> OnHttpChallenge -> store the challenge Token & Thumbprint.
	 -> OnDone          -> the certificate is not ready yet, try later.
### 2. HTTP Challenge
	Let's Encrypt -> http://(domain)/.well-known/acme-challenge/(token) <- Thumbprint
### 3. Retrieve the certificate
(you have to do this periodically  because the certificate lives only for 90 days !)

	TExecuteACME.RegisterDomain();
	 -> Account.key     -> Retrieve account status.
	 -> Domain.key      -> Retrieve the Certificate from Let's Encrypt.
	 -> OnCertificate   -> store the updated certificate.
### 4. Revoke certificate (if required)
	 TExecuteACME.UnRegisterDomain();
	 -> Domain.key      -> Revoke Certificat
	 -> OnDone          -> the certificate is revoked.
